# Mandelbrot Set

I've been playing with simple console based Mandelbrot sets in BASIC and Assembly 
language for the 6502 and Z80 8-bit processors to see how fast they run on the
home built 8-bit machines I've been building. I wanted to compare the speed on a 
modern processor and language, so I wrote this simple C# translation of the BASIC 
version. This runs in 890 MS and I expect a good portion of that is Spectre.Console
parsing the colours.
